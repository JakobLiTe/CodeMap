Hi, Im Jakob

Im a student learning front-end development and building projects to improve my skills.
My focus right now is learning  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating small games, interactive pages, and school-related projects.

This repository serves as my workspace and portfolio for now
I will proably continue learning and developing better code over time.
More projects will most likely be added as i learn and stuff.
