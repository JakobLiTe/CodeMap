Hi, I’m Jakob

I’m a student learning front-end development and building projects to improve my skills.
My focus right now is experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating small games, interactive pages, and school-related projects.

This repository serves as my workspace and portfolio as I continue learning and developing better code over time.
More projects will be added as I grow and explore new ideas.
